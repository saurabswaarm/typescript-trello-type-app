1 - We fill the form and this generates
    a Project object, which immediately 
    afterwards gets added to the 
    ProjectState

2 - At the ProjectState the moment an
    an object is received, it fires all
    the listeners. Basically it listens 
    for changes.

3 - A listener is a function originating
    from the ListSetup that takes the 
    Project[], filters it for matching 
    Project Objects and adds it to its
    own collection. Once that is done it
    hits renderItems(), which generates
    the ProjectItem components.
